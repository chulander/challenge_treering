### Problem Set 2

Suppose that we map an integer representation to every letter of the alphabet such that a/A = 1, b/B = 2, c/C = 3, ... z/Z = 26. Given a string containing only integers, write an algorithm to count the total number of possible integer to letter combinations that are possible. For example, if given the string '111', this could represent the character equivalent of 'a a a', 'a k', or 'k a'; our algorithm should return the result of 3 for this example string.
